# Hardware-in-the-loop probe

Talks SLIP-framed OSC to a board running one of the Oscuino sketches, over USB
CDC. Standard library only — it opens the tty and sets raw mode with `termios`,
so there is nothing to install.

```sh
arduino-cli compile --fqbn adafruit:samd:adafruit_gemma_m0 \
    --upload --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX examples/GemmaOscuino
python3 test/hardware/oscprobe.py /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

It checks what the host suite structurally cannot: that a real board, behind a
real USB stack, actually answers.

| probe | what it would catch |
|---|---|
| A single frame in one write | the sketch does not respond at all |
| B the same frame one byte at a time, 6 ms apart | inbound state discarded between `loop()` iterations — this is the case that fails when `bundleIN` is declared inside `loop()` |
| C a bundle carrying an `'I'` argument beside a routed message | a zero-byte type making the decoder reject the whole bundle |
| D two frames in a single write | SLIP losing a packet boundary when the next frame is already buffered |
| E `/s/d`, `/s/a` | pin-count clamping |
| F `/a/0` | the ordinary read path |

## Why B matters

With `bundleIN` declared inside `loop()`, this probe returns **zero frames for
every case, including A** — the board answers nothing at all. Hoisting the
bundle to file scope is what makes the sketch work; verified on an Adafruit
Gemma M0 by flashing both variants against the same library.

## The other probes

`echotest.py` — flash `OscEcho/`, which decodes an inbound packet with the
library and re-encodes it with the library. A byte-identical reply means decoder
and encoder agree on the wire format *on target*. 22 cases covering every type,
string and blob lengths 0-5, empty strings and zero-length blobs next to other
arguments, impulse/null mixed with real data, bundles and timetags.

`widths.py` — flash `IntWidths/`, which builds one message from all eleven
integer spellings. Checks which OSC type tag each produced on the target and
reports `sizeof(int/long/long long/double)`. This is the only test of the
integer-dispatch fix on a platform where `int` is 16 bits and `long` is 32.

`stress.py` — up to 50 SLIP frames back to back in a single write, each carrying
its own index, to look for lost packet boundaries.

## Measured

| board | echo | widths | probe | stress |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LilyPad USB (ATmega32U4) | 22/22 | 11/11, int=2 long=4 ll=8 double=4 | 7/7 | — |
| Teensy 4.0 | 22/22 | — | 7/7 | 0 frames lost up to 50 |
| Gemma M0 (SAMD21) | — | — | 7/7 | — |
